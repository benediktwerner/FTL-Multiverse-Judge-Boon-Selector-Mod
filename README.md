Allows selecting the boon you receive from the Judges at the start of a run instead of it being based on the previous run. You can only select boons that you have already unlocked by presenting the corresponding crew/system/weapon to the Judges.

This obviously can screw with the balance a bit since some boons are rather OP but I don't really find the current system very satisfying since many of the boons only make sense if you play a rather similar ship/setup to what you just played (e.g. presenting crew generally improves playing the same race again or presenting a max Drone Control improves playing with Drones again).

## Compatibility with other Multiverse addons

Currently, boons from Forgotten Races, Forgotten Diamonds, Insurrection+ Selection (IPS), Forgemaster, C&C Weapons: Renegade Collection, and FTL: Fishier Than Light are supported.

For this to work properly, make Judge Boon Selector is patched after them i.e. is lower in the patch order in Slipstream.
