    <![CDATA[ 
Allows you to select any of the Judge Boons at the start of a run, provided you have unlocked/received them at least once.

Requires Multiverse to be installed and this needs to be patched after Multiverse.

Patch after Forgotten Races, Forgotten Diamonds, Insurrection+ Selection, Forgemaster, C&C Weapons: Renegade Collection, Fishier Than Light, Darkest Desire, and Annelids Isolated if you are using them.
